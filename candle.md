Candlestick Components
A daily candlestick shows the market's open, high, low, and close price for the day. The candlestick has a wide part, which is called the "real body." 

This real body represents the price range between the open and close of that day's trading. When the real body is filled red, it means the close was lower than the open. If the real body is green, it means the close was higher than the open.
