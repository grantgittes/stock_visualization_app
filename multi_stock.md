#### Single Stock Analysis Options:

This analysis shows multiple stocks on a standard scale.  The best way to think about it is how $100 would perform invested in each of these stocks held from the beginning of the period until the end.  

The time horizon can be adjusted with the radio buttons, or a custom date range can be used that allows returns back 10 years.

The periodicity can also be adjusted to show daily, weekly or monthly returns, which can smooth out the trends.
