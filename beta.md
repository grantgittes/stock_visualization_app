### Beta Description and Calculation

Beta is a measure of the sytematic risk of an induvidual security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole.  It forms the basis for the capital asset pricing model, which is used for determining cost of capital for all assets.

There are many ways to calculate Beta or estimate it based either on regression of historical trends or more theoretical and opaque [see Barra Beta](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/ff81e4d0-a6a6-4b99-923d-35dc2161df1c).

However, the more simple method is regressing the returns of the S&P500 and the returns of a security, calculated based on a certain periodicity (daily, weekly, monthly), over a certain time horizon.  The linear coefficient of X is the predicted beta.  The intercept is not usually used, as the efficient market hypothesis assumes no outsized returns without increased risk.  

Commonly used beta calculations are 5-years/monthly (used by Yahoo Finance) and 2-years/weekly (used by Bloomberg).  However, different periods can be used if the company has undergone a significant change (i.e. major acquisition or disposition).
